# ü©∏ Blood Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based approach to detect blood cancer using data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation techniques. The project leverages various classification algorithms to identify early signs of blood cancer from medical data.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `Blood_Cancer_Detection.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow: EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Project overview, instructions, and details (you are here).

## üí° Objective

To build a reliable machine learning model that can assist in the early detection of blood cancer using diagnostic data, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and support clinical decision-making.

## üìä Dataset

- The dataset contains medical test parameters for patients.
- Features include various blood indicators (e.g., WBC count, RBC count, Hemoglobin, etc.).
- Target variable: Binary indicator for blood cancer presence.
